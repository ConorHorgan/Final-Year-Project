Hi There!

Thank you for downloading this landing page HTML. This is based on http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/custom-envato-meetup-landing-page-for-you-guys-/178085 and has been coded for community as a goodwill gesture by http://themeforest.net/user/theemon (aka theem’on).

If you're going to host an envato meetup, feel free to use this Landing Page HTML and make your event landing page look awesome. But if not, well then also you can edit it and use it for other event purposes, most of the sections required are already there. :)

We hope you will have a fun time using this template. Please take a minute and appreciate our work by following us on ThemeForest (http://www.themeforest.net/user/theemon/follow?_ga=1.4791860.688282265.1429195895), that would be very nice of you. And don't forget to share! :)
